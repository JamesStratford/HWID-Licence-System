# HWID-Licence-System

Python database and webserver made to control distribution of files to verified computers. Should be paired with a .exe loader which sends the webserver requests with the users unique HWID, and if their HWID is valid, allows access to the file routes.

I understand that this project has low security, this is not meant to be used for commerical purposes.
